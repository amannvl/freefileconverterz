As a maintainer, you are expected to:

1. **Review Pull Requests**: Provide timely, constructive feedback on pull requests.
2. **Triage Issues**: Help triage issues, label them appropriately, and direct discussions.
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure code quality remains high and follows the project's coding standards.

5. **Community**: Be welcoming to new contributors and help them get started.
6. **Security**: Handle security disclosures responsibly and follow the project's security policy.

## Becoming a Maintainer

We're always looking for new maintainers! To become a maintainer:

1. Make several non-trivial contributions to the project.
2. Demonstrate a commitment to the project and its community.
3. Be nominated by an existing maintainer.
4. Be approved by a majority of the existing maintainers.

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: For tracking bugs and feature requests
- **Discord**: [Join our community](https://discord.gg/freefileconverterz) for real-time discussions
- **Email**: maintainers@freefileconverterz.com for private communication

## Decision Making

Decisions are made through discussion among all maintainers, with the goal of reaching a consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the Project Lead will make the final decision.

## Code of Conduct

All maintainers are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and help enforce it.

## Stepping Down

If a maintainer wishes to step down, they should notify the other maintainers and the Project Lead. They may be granted emeritus status, which allows them to remain in the maintainers list with a note indicating their emeritus status.

## Inactive Maintainers

Maintainers who have been inactive for 6 months or more may be moved to emeritus status. This is not a punishment, but a way to keep the list of active maintainers current.

## Emeritus Maintainers

We thank these former maintainers for their contributions to the project:
